	<description>
		This method provides the ability to programmatically give a cell focus. The cell to give focus to is selected by the `dt-api cell()` method and the `dt-type cell-selector` given to it.

		If the selected cell is not in the DataTable's current page, the paging will be adjusted to make it visible and the table redraw.

		Tables which are disabled (`kt-api keys.disable()`) cannot have cells focused. You must either give the cell focus before disabling, or re-enable the table (`kt-api keys.enable()`) to allow focusing, even via the API.

		If a different cell has focus when this method is called, it will cause that cell to be blurred before this one is selected.
