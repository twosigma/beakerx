	<description>
		When working with complex tables it is not uncommon to have certain columns that you might not wish to allow spreadsheet like navigation on (for example a checkbox column for row selection or a column with editing action buttons). This option can be used to define which columns can receive focus. If a column cannot receive focus KeyTable will skip over it as if it was not present.

		Please note that only visible cells can receive focus, so the columns defined by this option are automatically merged with the visible columns in the table. Non-visible columns will not receive focus.
